## Current Design (Premium/Refined)

For comparison, the current live design uses:
- Elegant serif fonts (Cormorant Garamond)
- Forest green + gold color scheme
- Soft, refined aesthetic

**Feedback:** Feels "dainty" - too delicate for strong men demographic

## Recommendation

All four alternatives address the "dainty" concern with bold, masculine approaches. Choose based on:

1. **Option 1: Bold/Athletic** - energetic, athletic, performance-focused (youngest demographic)
2. **Option 2: Industrial/Modern** - durable, engineered, craftsman-focused (builders, makers)
3. **Option 3: Dark/Powerful** - luxury, exclusive, dramatic impact (tech/supercar enthusiasts)
4. **Option 4: Whiskey Lounge** - sophisticated, timeless, comfortable (traditional golf club members)

**Most Versatile:** Option 4 (Whiskey Lounge) bridges traditional and modern, appealing to golfers who appreciate both heritage and quality without feeling aggressive or overly modern.

Or we can combine elements from multiple options to create a custom hybrid approach.
